#### **Slide 1: Title Slide**

- **Title**: **"Playfair Cipher Encryption/Decryption Algorithm"**
- **Subtitle**: Understanding the process of encryption and decryption using Playfair cipher.
- **Visuals**: An image of a cipher wheel or a classic cryptography graphic.
- **Narration**: "Welcome to this presentation on the Playfair cipher, a classical encryption technique that uses digraphs to secure messages."

#### **Slide 2: Introduction to Playfair Cipher**

- **Content**: 
  - The Playfair cipher is a digraph substitution cipher that encrypts pairs of letters, commonly used in historical military communications.
  - Invented by Charles Wheatstone in 1854, but named after Lord Playfair, who promoted its use.
  - It uses a 5x5 grid of letters based on a keyword.
  
- **Visuals**: 
  - A 5x5 matrix with some sample letters.
  - Optional: Image of Charles Wheatstone or Lord Playfair.

- **Narration**: 
  "The Playfair cipher encrypts pairs of letters called digraphs using a 5x5 matrix derived from a key. It was popularized by Lord Playfair and was one of the first cipher systems that encrypted pairs rather than single letters."

#### **Slide 3: Input Handling in the Code**

- **Content**: 
  - The code starts by receiving three inputs from the user:
    1. **P**: The plaintext or ciphertext.
    2. **K**: The encryption/decryption key.
    3. **C**: The choice to either encrypt or decrypt (E/D).
  - These inputs are cleaned to remove spaces and make everything uppercase for uniformity.
  
- **Code Highlight**:

  ```python
  P = input("Enter plaintext (P): ").replace(" ", "").upper()
  K = input("Enter key (K): ").replace(" ", "").upper()
  C = input("Do you want to Encrypt or Decrypt (E/D)? ").upper()
  ```

- **Visuals**: 
  - Input fields representing the plaintext, key, and choice (encrypt or decrypt).
  
- **Narration**: 
  "The first step is to take inputs from the user: the plaintext or ciphertext, the key, and the choice to either encrypt or decrypt. The inputs are cleaned by removing spaces and converting all characters to uppercase."

#### **Slide 4: Building the 5x5 Matrix**

- **Content**: 
  - The matrix is constructed by removing duplicate letters from the key, followed by the remaining letters of the alphabet (with 'J' being excluded).
  - The final matrix contains 25 characters.
  
- **Code Highlight**:

  ```python
  used = []
  for char in K:
      if char not in used and char in alphabet:
          used.append(char)

  for char in alphabet:
      if char not in used:
          used.append(char)

  for i in range(0, 25, 5):
      matrix.append(used[i:i + 5])
  ```

- **Visuals**: 
  - A visual representation of how the matrix is constructed, showing the key being inserted, followed by the remaining alphabet.
  - An example of a matrix created using the key "PLAYFAIR".

  Example matrix:
  ```
  P L A Y F
  I R B C D
  E G H K M
  N O Q S T
  U V W X Z
  ```

- **Narration**: 
  "The matrix is built by first adding unique letters from the key, and then filling the remaining slots with letters from the alphabet, skipping the letter 'J'. This matrix is key to both encryption and decryption."

#### **Slide 5: Playfair Cipher Encryption Rules**

- **Content**: 
  - Encryption in Playfair cipher works by splitting the plaintext into pairs (digraphs).
  - Three rules govern the encryption process:
    1. **Same Row**: Shift right.
    2. **Same Column**: Shift down.
    3. **Rectangle Rule**: Swap corners of the rectangle formed by the pair of letters.

- **Code Highlight** (Handling Digraphs):

  ```python
  if a_row == b_row:
      ciphertext += matrix[a_row][(a_col + 1) % 5] + matrix[b_row][(b_col + 1) % 5]
  elif a_col == b_col:
      ciphertext += matrix[(a_row + 1) % 5][a_col] + matrix[(b_row + 1) % 5][b_col]
  else:
      ciphertext += matrix[a_row][b_col] + matrix[b_row][a_col]
  ```

- **Visuals**: 
  - Illustrations of the three rules using the matrix created earlier.
    - Same Row: Show a pair of letters in the same row shifting right.
    - Same Column: Show a pair in the same column shifting down.
    - Rectangle Rule: Highlight a pair of letters in a rectangle and show how they swap corners.

- **Narration**: 
  "The Playfair cipher encrypts pairs of letters based on their position in the matrix. If both letters are in the same row, they shift right. If they are in the same column, they shift down. If they form a rectangle, the letters swap positions diagonally."

---

#### **Slide 6: Handling the Plaintext (Special Cases)**

- **Content**: 
  - If the same letter repeats in a pair (digraph), insert an 'X' between them.
  - If the plaintext has an odd number of letters, append an 'X' at the end to complete the final pair.

- **Code Highlight**:

  ```python
  while i < len(P):
      if i + 1 < len(P) and P[i] == P[i + 1]:
          plaintext += P[i] + "X"
          i += 1
      else:
          plaintext += P[i]
          i += 1
  if len(plaintext) % 2 != 0:
      plaintext += "X"
  ```

- **Visuals**: 
  - Show a pair of repeated letters (e.g., "LL" in "HELLO") with an 'X' inserted between them.
  - Show an odd-length plaintext being padded with an 'X'.

- **Narration**: 
  "To avoid issues with repeated letters in a digraph, an 'X' is inserted between the repeated characters. If the plaintext has an odd number of characters, an 'X' is appended at the end."

#### **Slide 7: Decryption Process**

- **Content**: 
  - The decryption process reverses the encryption using the same matrix but applies the inverse of the Playfair cipher rules.
  - For the same row, shift left; for the same column, shift up; and for rectangle pairs, swap the corners diagonally.
  
- **Code Highlight**:

  ```python
  if a_row == b_row:
      plaintext += matrix[a_row][(a_col - 1) % 5] + matrix[b_row][(b_col - 1) % 5]
  elif a_col == b_col:
      plaintext += matrix[(a_row - 1) % 5][a_col] + matrix[(b_row - 1) % 5][b_col]
  else:
      plaintext += matrix[a_row][b_col] + matrix[b_row][a_col]
  ```

- **Visuals**: 
  - Show the inverse of the encryption process using the same examples.
  
- **Narration**: 
  "Decryption follows the reverse process of encryption. For digraphs in the same row, we shift left, and for the same column, we shift up. For rectangle pairs, we swap corners diagonally, just as in encryption."

#### **Slide 8: Example Run**

- **Content**: 
  - Example input:
    - **Key**: PLAYFAIR
    - **Plaintext**: HELLO
    - **Encrypted Text**: Output will vary based on the rules applied.
  
- **Visuals**: 
  - Show the matrix created using the key "PLAYFAIR".
  - Step through the process of encrypting "HELLO" into ciphertext.
  
- **Narration**: 
  "Let's see an example in action. With the key 'PLAYFAIR', we encrypt the plaintext 'HELLO'. Following the Playfair rules, the digraphs are processed and encrypted into ciphertext."

#### **Slide 9: Summary**

- **Content**: 
  - The Playfair cipher uses digraph substitution to encrypt and decrypt messages.
  - It's relatively simple but secure for its time.
